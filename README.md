### Scheduled Syncing Forks with Upstream Repo
  FE Patch `1.0.8` adds support to sync your repo with upstream repo - scheduled (default: every 6 hours) 
  > [!NOTE]
  > Tnx: [lobe-chat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat) & [ous50](https://github.com/ous50)

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >  - For this upstream pulling action to work, you need to enable [Upstream Sync](.github/workflows/cp_pull_upstream.yml) Github Action.
  >  - And the action'll create an issue in your fork if pulling is unsuccesfull. So you need to enable `issues` for your fork with your repositories settings (`Settings` `-->` `General` `-->` `Features` `Issues`)
  >  - For more information on how this action works: [lobe-chat's Sync Feature Wiki - en-US](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/wiki/Upstream-Sync) & [lobe-chat's Sync Feature Wiki - zh-CN](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/wiki/Upstream-Sync.zh-CN)

  > [!TIP]
  >  - You can change schedule by editing `- cron: '0 */6 * * *'` in [cp_pull_upstream.yml](.github/workflows/cp_pull_upstream.yml)
  >  - For more information on `- cron` of Github Actions, visit [Github Documentation - Scheduling Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)

  > [!CAUTION]
  >  - IF you use another method (maybe a Github App), to sync your forks with upstream repos, (for ex: [Pull by Wei](https://github.com/wei/pull)), you should disable the `Upstream Sync` action by going through, `Actions` `-->` `Upstream Sync` `-->` `Right Top Menu [...]` `-->` `Disable Workflow`
  >  - For more information on how to disable a workflow: [Github Documentation on Disabling & Enabling Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow)

> [!NOTE]
> For Generic `Linux` and `MacOS` instructions, use [source repository](https://github.com/msojocs/fiddler-everywhere-enhance)

> [!CAUTION]
> Please don't use this patch for illegal matters. And we'd love if you can buy and support the officials: [Please Support](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/fiddler)

### Fiddler Everywhere Crashing at Startup

If you encounter this issue, it's most likely unrelated to the patch! You should confirm it!

- Check logs by running `Fiddler Everywhere.exe` from the terminal.
  Pay special attention to the following line. (it’s omitted in the official, non-patched version of Fiddler Everywhere.)
  ```bash
  Server error log during start: System.IO.IOException: Failed to bind to address http://localhost:8868.
  ```

  If you see this, it's completely unrelated to the patch. You should see the same issue with the `non-patched official FE`. Confirm this. 

- Check Fiddler Everywhere logs in `%AppData%\Fiddler Everywhere\logs\`

- Check `Administered port exclusions` to see if port `8868` is restricted. 
You can check it with:
  ```bash
  netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp
  ```

- If port `8868` is restricted, 
  - You should also see the same issue with the `non-patched official FE`. Confirm this.
  - You can try removing port `8868` from `Administered port exclusions`. 

You should also follow issue [#44](https://github.com/auto-yui-patch/fiddler-everywhere-patch-automated/issues/44#issuecomment-3497425472) ; Special tnx to [@choneas](https://github.com/choneas). 

If this didn't solve your problem, feel free to open an issue.
